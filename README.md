Rainfall plays a vital role in shaping India’s climate system, significantly influencing agriculture, water resources, and the economy. Understanding rainfall patterns over time is crucial for effective planning in areas such as agriculture, disaster management, and urban water supply. If you're interested in learning how to analyze rainfall trends in a country, this guide is for you. Here, we'll explore Rainfall Trends in India Analysis using Python.

This analysis focuses on identifying long-term trends, seasonal variations, and anomalies in India’s rainfall data. We will investigate historical patterns, pinpoint years with extreme or deficient rainfall, examine the relationship between seasonal and annual rainfall, and use time series models to forecast future rainfall.

The dataset for this analysis spans over a century and includes monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall measurements. It offers valuable insights through monthly rainfall data, seasonal aggregates (such as monsoon rainfall), and annual totals, making it ideal for studying variability, detecting anomalies, and forecasting trends.
